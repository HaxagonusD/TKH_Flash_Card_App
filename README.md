# Julian Quezada's Flash Card App
---

##### How this works: 
    -Type a quetion
    -Type an answer 
    -Click the add button to add the flash card to the screen
    -The delete button deltes the flash card
    -The edit button edits the answer of the flashcard
    -The Show/Hide button hides the answer 

##### How this works internally:
    -The initial state of the screen is created in html
    -Flash cards are created in Javascript
    -Flash cards are appended to an invisible container in the HTML
    -Used SASS to write terrible javascript but this is not important
